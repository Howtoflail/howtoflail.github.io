									<h1>First person shooter</h1>
									<p>A first person shooter that takes place during The Civil War. The goal is to fight the zombies that just killed the men 
                                        you commanded, find their source of power and destroy it.

								<p>This game has been done through an university project in collaboration with one more student.
                                    The features of the game can be observed in the gameplay video below. Later on, I will talk about 
                                    how far we've actually gotten to reaching our goals, after which 
                                    I will talk about my contribution to the game.

                                <h2>Scope of the game and related information about the project</h2>
                                <p>In this section I will talk about the scope of the project, what we achieved and what we didn't, and overall information about the
                                    game and the project.
                                </p>
                                <p>Firstly, I'd like to show the story of the game, the core loop and the visuals that we were going for. This part
                                    is about the prototyping of the game.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Story</h3>
                                <p><i>You are part of the sixth company on the Union side of The Civil War. When stationed at the border of Oklahoma 
                                    and Texas with the rest of your company to investigate what the Confederates are doing to gain more territory. You discover that 
                                    the Confederates are using a biochemical weapon, which turns soldiers into brainless mutants with one objective: 
                                    kill Union soldiers. It is now your job to destroy the Confederate labs, while fighting off mutant soldiers.</i></p>
                                <h3>Visual style</h3>
                                <p>Realistic, apocalyptic, war</p>
                                <div class="image">
                                    <img src="images/FPS_Art1.jpg" alt="Art picture"/> <br/>
                                    <img src="images/FPS_Art2.jpg" alt="Art picture"/> <br/>
                                    <img src="images/FPS_Art3.jpg" alt="Art picture"/> <br/>
                                </div> 
                                <h3>Core loop</h3>
                                <p>You spawn in the fields, heading towards the enemy camp, where you kill mutants that are in the way, 
                                    collect ammo scattered around the battlefields and make your way to the end of the map, where you will 
                                    find a laboratory that you will have to destroy.</p>
                                <h3>Scope of the project</h3>
                                <p>The scope of this project was bigger than what we achieved, due to having to learn how to make the features that we wanted the game to have.
                                    In the end, we accomplished most of our goals, but it could be improved visual wise to give the feeling that we wanted.
                                    This project took 4 weeks to complete.
                                </p>

                                <h2>My contribution to the project</h2>
                                <p>In this section, I will discuss the significant contributions I made to the project through 
                                    meticulous documentation in the form of development logs (devlogs).</p>
                                <h3>Weapons devlog</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Challenge:</b> 
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">In order to fit the aesthetic and setting of our game, it was decided that 
                                            the main weapon that you play with is going to be a bolt action rifle, since the action takes place during 
                                            the Civil War and you having the rank of a Sergeant Major, so having a good weapon makes the most sense. In order 
                                            to bring some diversity to the game, a secondary weapon and a knife are also added to the player's arsenal. The secondary 
                                            weapon is a shotgun, which is meant to deal a lot of damage at close range, like in a real life situation, but it also needs
                                             to deal little damage or miss at longer distances because it would otherwise become overpowered and the player would always 
                                             choose the shotgun in favor of the rifle, which is not the intended gameplay. The amount of ammo that the player finds during
                                              the gameplay is also a very important factor when designing this, but this will not be a part of this devlog. The knife is 
                                              part of the player's arsenal because every soldier has a melee weapon ready to use, in case he has no more ammo left, is 
                                              currently reloading or enemies are rapidly approaching and engaging into a fight.<br/>
                                            The challenge is to make a hitscan shooting system, for both the bolt action rifle and the shotgun because it makes 
                                            the most sense in a small scale game. Replicating the feel of a bolt action rifle is a very important element because it makes 
                                            the player feel more engaged and connected to the game: cocking the gun after each shot, longer reload time and overall slower to 
                                            operate than a modern gun. The shotgun works on a very similar idea as the bolt action rifle, only it does not need to be cocked 
                                            after every shot, but it being a double barrel shotgun, you can only shoot twice before needing to reload. The knife will make use 
                                            of an animation in order to hit enemies, and the knife object will have a collider in order to detect hits on the enemies.</p></li>

                                            <u>Component testing:</u><br/>
                                            This was used in order to test the functionalities of the guns before integrating them to the player model that was used
                                             for the final version of the game, which had animation rigging and animations, meaning that there could be a lot more
                                             problems than expected. Testing them separately, without the use of models for guns was an important step because like
                                             I mentioned before, it is better to test the functionality first and fix the current issues, than to put the gun models
                                             and have to worry about more problems that could arise.

                                    <li><b>Results:</b>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">For the first prototype of the main gun, a cube was used in place of the actual weapon, 
                                            and in order to make it similar to how it will function when it's going to be fully implemented, the gun was inside 
                                            an empty object named "Gun holder", which rotated at the same time and with the same value as the camera on the x axis, 
                                            in order to move it up and down:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Gun_rotation_on_camera.gif" alt="Gun rotation on camera"/></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">Now that the first prototype of the gun has been set up, it is time to implement the shooting mechanic. 
                                            For the shooting mechanic, raycast is used in order to cast a ray that is starting from the camera's position and rotation, 
                                            in the direction of where it's pointing. Note that the shot is being cast from the camera and not the gun in order to avoid 
                                            strange behavior of the gun (in case it is not orienting correctly) and to avoid being able to shoot through walls. A range was 
                                            also added to this, so it's impossible to shoot at an infinite distance, and after testing and doing some tweaking, I found the 
                                            right amount of range for the gun in order to not be able to "cheese" the enemies that will be in the future, so not being able to 
                                            shoot them from very far because that doesn't give the feeling of challenge anymore. The first prototype of the gun shooting mechanic 
                                            can be seen in this gif, in which I have added an impact force to when the raycast hits, so that it pushes the target a tiny bit:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Gun_prototype_shot.gif" alt="Gun prototype shot" /></div>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The next step I took in order to make the gun feel like an actual bolt action rifle and not break the immersion of the player, 
                                            I added a shot sound to the gun, and with the use of coroutines I created a system that prevents the player from shooting the gun 
                                            until the sound of the shooting is over. It is important to note that this system was used for shooting because it needs to 
                                            replicate the feel of a bolt action rifle, which you need to cock after every shot, so that is why you can only shoot after 
                                            the sound is finished. Ideally, an animation of cocking the gun should also be played along with the sound, but in this case 
                                            it proved too difficult to implement (the gun model needs rigging, an animation needs to be recorded specifically for the gun
                                            and more). I also prevented the player from shooting while the gun is reloading of course, and all of this can be seen in the 
                                            video <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFco5sxJXaU&ab_channel=Peter">I have uploaded on YouTube</a></b>.</p> 
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The reload mechanic is relatively simple because it checks for how many bullets are left in the magazine, and if it has 
                                            reached 0, or if there are fewer bullets in the magazine than the maximum amount and the player has pressed the "R" key, 
                                            it will start reloading, provided there is enough ammo left, of course. I added an extra quirk to the reload mechanic by 
                                            making a coroutine to check if the player has pressed the "R" key before the sound of the shot is done playing, so it waits 
                                            out for the shot sound to finish and then it starts the reload coroutine, making it a little easier for the player to reload 
                                            if he wants to because it can get frustrating to have to wait for the sound/animation to finish to be able to press "R" and reload.</p>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The shotgun uses the same concepts as the bolt action rifle, but it does not cock the gun after each shot, and instead can shoot twice, 
                                            after which it needs to reload. The unique part about the shotgun is that it has a different mechanic to how the bullets are actually fired, 
                                            meaning the raycasts. Instead of projecting a ray that is starts from the camera and is pointed to the center of the screen, the shotgun uses 4 rays, 
                                            simulating real life pallets of a shotgun, and each one goes in a different direction:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Shotgun_pallets_edited.gif" alt="Shotgun pallets" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">As shown above, the pallets' direction is different for each pallet. One goes up, one goes down, one to the left and one to the right.<br/><br/>
                                            Now that the first prototype of the first gun is working, it is time to look for gun model fit for the game, making sure it fits with the game's aesthetic.
                                            The model that I found is of a Kar98, and it seemed like the best choice because of the clean look of the model and because it is old enough. Even though the 
                                            game's story is set during The Civil War and Kar98 is more modern than that (first used in 1935), it did fit the aesthetic of the game.</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Kar98_before.png" alt="Kar 98" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">As you can see in the picture, the model came with some bullets, which unfortunately were part of the gun model 
                                            (that being how the modeler left it), and could not be simply deleted or moved through Unity, so I had to cut them out in Blender.<br/><br/>
                                            After attaching the gun to the character, and rigging it, which is described in detail in the following devlog about animations, 
                                            I created a particle effect for the gun shot and one for the impact hit, whenever a target is hit by a bullet, in order to give 
                                            a more immersive and overall better feel of the game:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Gun_particles_edited.gif" alt="Gun particles" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">As you can see from the gif, there is a shot particle effect and there is an impact particle effect. Both weapons use the same effects, 
                                            but I showcased both of them because the shot particle is more clear on the bolt action rifle. The shot particle effect also has a point
                                            light as a child object, which is turned on whenever the gun is shot, to simulate the lighting that is produced when a gun is shot in 
                                            real life, so if this was in a dark room, it would light up the room slightly, for less than one second. The impact particle 
                                            effect is responsive to the actual hit, so it angles based on how the raycast actually hit the object, involving the rotation as well.</p>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The knife weapon makes use of an animation in order to attack, which is described the following devlog about animations. 
                                            In order to register the hit on an enemy, all enemies need to have a Rigidbody component on them for this to work because the 
                                            knife makes use of a box collider, which has the "isTrigger" set to true. Also, a hit is registered on the enemy only when the 
                                            animation is played, or more precisely, when the player attacks with the knife because otherwise it would just damage an enemy if 
                                            it came close to the knife. The collider of the knife is quite big, but after making a lot of tweaks to its size, this was found to 
                                            be the optimal size for it to allow the player to hit the enemies from a realistic distance:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Knife_hitbox.png" alt="Knife hitbox" style="width: 90%;" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">Now that all of the mechanics of the weapons are implemented, it is time to configure the gun holder, which is the game object 
                                            that holds all of the weapons. This acts almost like an inventory with all the weapons, but it uses some logic when switching weapons. 
                                            Whenever the player switches the weapon, the rigging is also switched, which is all detailed in the following devlog about animations, 
                                            but it is also checked if the gun has finished firing, meaning the sound/animation has finished playing, or in case the knife is active 
                                            and about to be switched, if the animation of the hit is done playing. After this is checked, there is an extra check if the guns were 
                                            reloading during the moment that the gun was switched (not applicable to the knife), and if they were, the reload on the respective gun 
                                            will be reset, so the player will have to go through the whole reload animation when he switches back. This mechanic was added in order
                                            to make the feel of the guns more realistic and to not give the impression of a more arcade-ish game.</p>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The feature to zoom with the rifle was also added, making it easier to shoot at a longer distance. This was done by 
                                            lowering the camera's FOV when the right mouse button is held, and on release, bringing it back to normal:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Rifle_Zoom.gif" alt="Rifle zoom" /></div><br/>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Validation:</b>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">A lot of tweaking has been done on the weapons to make the player feel like he is playing in the time period 
                                            of The Civil War. For the bolt action rifle, different kind of sounds were tested in order to make the gun feel slow, because it 
                                            requires the player to wait between each shot, replicating the feel of having to cock the gun, so a longer time was chosen, same as 
                                            for the reload, since it replicates the feeling of having load the gun with one bullet at a time. The rifle is a powerful gun, so the 
                                            player can shoot from a good distance and kill the weaker enemies in one hit, but the tradeoff is that it takes a long time to operate
                                            and it is harder to use at close range. The shotgun, on the other hand, needs to have the feeling of being really powerful at 
                                            close range, dealing high damage, but getting increasingly worse at longer ranges. The pallet system that is used makes a great 
                                            job at that because every pallet has its own damage, so the further an enemy is, the fewer pallets will hit him. At close range 
                                            it is very effective and it will kill most of the enemies with all the four pallets hitting, but it is limited to two shots before 
                                            having to reload, and there is also a small timer in between shots, in order to make it viable and not extremely powerful. The knife 
                                            however, is limited to the animation that it uses, which has some issues with the rigging of the hands to the weapon, causing some 
                                            jitter, but it serves its purpose as intended. The collider or hitbox of the knife was increased in length until it gave the feel 
                                            that the player can attack enemies from a realistic hand-to-hand combat scenario. The knife can also hit more targets while attacking 
                                            because it is a slashing animation.</p>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">Overall, the feel of the weapons is that they belong to the time period of when the game takes place, but also that they are 
                                            part of an important soldier's arsenal.</p>

                                            of the player's model to the weapons, so that they move in accord to the body when aiming. Making the HUD is also related to the 
                                            guns and the player, since it shows the health of the player, how much ammo he has left on each weapon, the reload time of the guns, 
                                            and the most important, the crosshair.</p>

                                    <li><b>Challenge:</b> 
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The challenge is to find the proper animations for the player in order to give the feeling of a polished 
                                            game and to rig all of the weapons to the player's model, so that the hands are attached to the guns and they move accordingly to 
                                            the player's aim. The camera is part of the player's head, so whenever he aims up or down, the head moves with it, and when he aims
                                            left or right, the whole body rotates, which can be seen in the previous devlog. It is important to give the feeling of 
                                            realistic gun handling, so the goal is to make the hands and the gun move according to the aim, or more precisely, the head, since 
                                            it is a first-person shooter, and the player aims and is ready to shoot at all times.</p></li>

                                            This was used in order to test the rigging of the player's model to the guns separately of using animations because using 
                                            them together is a long and complicated process which requires a lot of tweaking and a lot of testing with Unity's animator 
                                            and avatar masks. Rigging of the character was done at first, after which animations were found and added to the process after 
                                            rigging was tested. Rigging was done and tested at first on the shotgun, and after it was implemented, the rifle and the knife were next.
                                        </li>
                                    <li><b>Results:</b>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The first step that I took to make the feel of the gun play more polished was to rig the guns to the 
                                            player's model. An animator and a rig builder component were placed on the parent object of the player. Afterwards, I found that
                                            inverse kinematics are the tool that is used in order to move the tip of a body part of a model, in this case the hand, and have
                                            all connected body parts follow and simulate the physics of that tip. The first rig that I created was the rig of the hands IK, 
                                            and to it I have added two empty objects to which I put two bone IK constraints. The objects had the following constraints: 
                                            the root was the arm, the mid was the forearm and the tip was the hands, so the model's whole arm followed the hand and made 
                                            its changes to the elbow and shoulder accordingly:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Arm_IK.gif" alt="Arm IK" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">In order for this to work, a target and a hint need to be attached to the two bone IK constraints. The target is basically
                                            the default position that you set that constraint to be in, and a hint, in this case is for the elbow, so that you can lower 
                                            or raise it. I made each hint a child of the respective arm's elbow, so for the left hand IK, the hint was inside the left 
                                            forearm object, and for the right hand IK, the right forearm object of the model. I found that it is best to put the target 
                                            inside the object that you want the actual constraint to follow, so I made the left hand target and the right hand target children
                                            of the shotgun object. After this, the gun was positioned at the right shoulder, since it made the most sense to belong to because 
                                            it was decided that the character is right handed:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Shotgun_location.png" alt="Shotgun location" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The next step was to configure these targets that I had set up in the shotgun object, in order for them to be placed correctly on 
                                            the weapon. A rig transform component was also added on the shotgun because it makes the targets follow the constrained object. After 
                                            placing the hand on the gun, I quickly realized that there was something wrong about the elbow placement, as can be seen in the example:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Rig_wrong_elbow.png" alt="Wrong elbow positon" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">This is where the hints come in to place, as they are children of the forearms of the respective hands. Moving the hints towards 
                                            outside of the arm fixed this issue:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Rig_correct_position.png" alt="Correct elbow positon" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">After polishing the position and rotation of the targets and the hints as to give a good impression of the player 
                                            actually holding the weapon, the next step was to create a second rig, which contained two multi-aim constraints: a body 
                                            aim and an aim object. The multi-aim constraint takes an object and makes it follow a target, so for the body aim I constrained 
                                            the spine, and for the aim I constrained the shoulder because it is the root object that moves when aiming up or down. Both of 
                                            these constraints' target was a sphere object and placed it at a short distance in front of the character, and at first I created 
                                            one to test if the functionality worked:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Rig_Following_Practice_Target.gif" alt="Rig_Following_Practice_Target" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">As can be seen in the gif, the spine is the first to bend after the target, and this is because the gun needs to be in front of 
                                            the camera, so the players' head at all times, in order to have a good feel in a first-person shooter game. Next, I made this 
                                            target's position be controlled by a script, which had one sole purpose of positioning the sphere at a distance from the player, 
                                            and in front of the camera at all times. This is the result:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Rig_Following_Target.gif" alt="Rig_Following_Target" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The only thing that needed to be done after this was to hide the target's mesh and to make sure that the collider was off, which it was.<br/><br/>
                                            Now that the first weapon was rigged, I had to repeat the same process for the bolt action rifle and the knife. First I disabled 
                                            the shotgun because there needs be only one gun active at a time and positioned the gun to the right shoulder. I created the left 
                                            hand and right hand target objects and placed them inside the rifle object, and a left hand and a right hand hint inside the elbows. 
                                            I created a script that handles gun changing inside the game, so that the player can switch weapons, and the rigging is also switched 
                                            to its relative weapon when done so. This is what it looked like after making the switch of the rigging based on the weapon work:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Rig_Changes_On_Weapon_Change.gif" alt="Rig_Changes_On_Weapon_Change" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">As you can see, the hands placement on each gun is also changed.<br/><br/>
                                            The same process was done for the knife, but since the knife requires only one hand to use, it was only rigged to the right hand, 
                                            whilst the left hand was placed away from the view of the player.
                                            After finishing up the rigging for all weapons and making them switch correctly, finding proper animations for the game was essential, 
                                            in order to make the game feel polished. The animations that are used in the game are an idle animation, which works when the player is
                                            not moving, a walking animation, which is played when the player moves, and a slashing animation, which is played when the player strikes
                                            with the knife (presses left mouse button). When I placed the animations in the animator and made the logic for them, I quickly realized 
                                            that the rig of the weapons was not working, so I had then discovered avatar masks. In an avatar mask you can choose which part of the 
                                            body is affected by the animation, and which one is not, and they can be set up to be used on specifically chosen layers inside the 
                                            animator. This is what the avatar mask of the main layer of the animator, which contained the idle and the walking animation, 
                                            looked like :</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Steve_Aims_Avatar_Mask.png" alt="Steve_Aims_Avatar_Mask" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">I selected out the upper body because that has to be controlled by the rig, and not by the default animations.</p>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">After this was set up, I tried creating an animation for reloading, by just pulling the gun down so that it gets out of the 
                                            player's sight, and return it to its original position after the reload was done. This proved too difficult to make because a 
                                            weird bug of making the player enter the ground appeared with it, and I didn't have the knowledge or time to fix it, so a small 
                                            bar in the HUD took place of this animation. I also created an avatar mask specifically for the reload, but to no 
                                            avail. This is what the animation looked like when I tried to integrate it into the animator and the flow of animations:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Reload_Animation_Bug.gif" alt="Reload_Animation_Bug" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">In order to attack using the knife, a swinging animation is played, which moves the hand in a swinging motion from right to 
                                            left and back to the right, whilst making use of the rig, so that the knife is in the hand of the player while doing so. The 
                                            knife has a collider on it, and whenever the animation is played, it detects collisions with enemies and damages them accordingly:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Knife_Animation.gif" alt="Knife_Animation" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">There are still a few issues with the animation, as can be seen in the gif because setting up the avatar mask for the knife 
                                            attack and making it work with the rigging of the hands to the weapon proved difficult.</p>

                                            that the HUD doesn't flood the screen, since it is a first-person shooter.</p></li>

                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The first step I took to making the HUD was to create a crosshair. At first, I created a canvas, 
                                            which is where all of the HUD elements are stored and it describes how they are manipulated on the screen. Making the crosshair
                                             was simple, I created an image object and made it a child of the canvas, chose a knob image, the color, and positioned it to the 
                                             center of the screen:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Crosshair.png" alt="Crosshair" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">Afterwards, I made two text objects, which are children of the canvas, and updated them based on the 
                                            values of the player's health, or the ammo that is relative to the gun that is active. Each gun has its own class, in which the 
                                            ammo lives separately, so when the gun is changed, the text objects enabled or disabled. This was done to prevent showing ammo when 
                                            the knife is active, since it has no ammo.</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Hud_Ammo_And_Health.png" alt="Hud_Ammo_And_Health" style="width: 100%;" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The next step was to make a reload bar, showing the player the time left until the reload of the 
                                            gun is finished because the animation proved to be difficult to add to the animations flow:</p>
                                            <div class="image"><img src="images/Reload_Bar.gif" alt="Reload bar" /></div><br/>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The reload bar was done by creating two image objects, one with a white image, and one with a black 
                                            image. They are both placed in the exact same position, and filling the bar is done by updating the fill property of the second 
                                            image based on the time left to reload for the respective gun.</p>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The reload bars are activated when the reload event happens, and disabled after it has finished 
                                            filling up the bar. The bar is also disabled when the gun is switched, even though the previous gun was still reloading.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Validation:</b>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">Tweaking was done on the size of the text, the color and the size of the reload bar, 
                                            in order to give the feeling of a minimalistic HUD.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Next steps:</b>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The next steps are to use images instead of text for health and ammo, giving a 
                                            better and more polished visual look.</p>
