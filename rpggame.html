								<p>I have recently started working on my own project, my own game, unrelated to school work, which is going to be an open world action rpg, 
                                    using Unreal Engine 5.1.1, and trying to make use of the most powerful technologies and features of this state of the art game engine, 
                                    while also making the game a good experience for the players. This game will include a huge map with more zones (will update this while 
                                    making progress), enemies that are hard to defeat, using a combat system similar to souls games, a looting system, all while using clean 
                                    animations and rigging for the character. The game will be third person and C++ is prioritized rather than blueprints, but they will still 
                                    be used for plenty of features.
                                </p>
                                <p>Note that I am in the early stages of making this game and learning UE5, while getting familiarized with C++ for game development 
                                at the same time. I will update this page as I make progress to the game.</p>

                                <h2>Devlogs</h2>
                                <p>In this section, I will explain the processes of creating the game and applying what I have learnt through 
                                    meticulous documentation in the form of development logs (devlogs).</p>
                                <h3>Landscape devlog</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Challenge:</b> 
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">The game is an open world action rpg, and the map must be done in accordance to an open world rpg, 
                                            which means that it needs to be big, with different zones. The challenge is to create a large map, split it into more zones 
                                            that have different visual styles and give a different feel. The map must be done in detail, meaning that foliage and objects 
                                            that belong to the specific zone will be placed in order to make the player more immersed and to give the impression that he 
                                            really is inside a forest, or mountains, or desert etc.</p></li>
                                    <li><b>Methods:</b>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">
                                            <u>Literature study (links):</u><br/>
                                            1. <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course/">Stephen Ulibarri's course on 
                                                Unreal Engine 5</a><br/>
                                        </p>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;"><u>Note:</u> Most of the knowledge of creating the map, the landscape and mostly everything comes from the 
                                            course listed above, but most aspects are recreated or used differently by me (different foliage, different landscape, different 
                                            texture layers etc).</p>
                                        </li>
                                    <li><b>Results:</b>
                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">At first, I created the map using the biggest size in Unreal Engine 5, which is 64 x 64 tiles because the 
                                            map needs to be large and needs to have diversity, so the size fits the aesthetic of the game. I placed a chair in the scene for 
                                            reference in order to see how big the map actually is, so what the player will experience throughout his gameplay.</p>
