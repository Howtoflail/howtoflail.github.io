									<h1>First person space shooter</h1>
									<p>A Sci-fi space piracy game with retro visuals where you shoot cargo vessels and bring their loot 
                                        back to your mothership while dodging enemy fire. Returning loot earns you credits which you can use to buy upgrades and ammo for your ship.
									</p>

								<p>This game has been done through an university project in collaboration with 3 more students and it is our first game.
                                    I will describe the features of the game and how far we've actually gotten to reaching our goals, after which 
                                    I will talk about my contribution to the game.
                                </p>
								<h2>Features of the game</h2>
								<p>The most important mechanics of any FPS game, including ours, is to be able to move and to shoot.</p>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/Move_And_Shoot.gif" alt="Move And Shoot gif" style="height: 80%; width: 80%;"/></div>
								<p>The shooting system is hitscan and it has a limited range. <br/>
                                    The movement of the spaceship is three dimensional, so it can pitch, yaw and roll, like real aircraft.<br />
                                    More about this later.</p>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/Enemy_AI.gif" alt="Enemy AI" style="height: 90%; width: 90%;"/></div>
								<p>The game also has enemy spaceships that attack you on sight, since you're a space pirate set out for plunder.</p>
								<p>As described in the subtitle, you can gun down enemy ships, which will <b>drop credits that you can collect</b>. <br />
                                    Upgrading the spaceship is not implemented, but this will be explained in more detail later on.</p>
                                <div class="image"><img src="images/Shooting_Enemies.gif" alt="Shooting enemies" style="height: 90%; width: 90%;"/></div>
								<p>Another essential feature of the game, that can be seen in the gif above, is that enemies that shoot at you will show a marker
                                    that <b>indicates their position</b> relative to where you are currently looking at.</p>
                                <p>Two other things worth mentioning is that the spaceship can <b>boost</b> its movement speed using its thrusters, 
                                    but it has to recharge before it can be used again. This can be seen in the gif above, in the second bar on the bottom of the screen.<br />
                                    The spaceship also has a <b>rechargable shield</b>, which is the blue part of the first bar on the bottom of the screen, that automatically starts
                                    to recharge after not taking damage for a few seconds.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Scope of the game and related information about the project</h2>
                                <p>In this section I will talk about the scope of the project, what we achieved and what we didn't, and overall information about the
                                    game and the project.
                                </p>
                                <p>Firstly, I'd like to show the story of the game, the core loop and the visuals that we were going for. This part
                                    is about the prototyping of the game.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Story</h3>
                                <p><i>You are an ensign of the feared Argonian Rebellion, a group of rogues known for plundering cargo ships and causing general mayhem. 
                                    Your task is to raid ships and keep your convoy safe in the meantime. Since the Federation has put 
                                    their eye on the Rebellion, this task is more dangerous than ever before. 
                                    Will you be able to hold your own in a rain of federation laser blasts, while still plundering the cargo holds of their convoys?</i></p>
                                <h3>Visual style</h3>
                                <p>Retro, low polly</p>
                                <div class="image">
                                    <img src="images/SpaceShip_Art1.png" alt="Art picture"/> <br/>
                                    <img src="images/SpaceShip_Art2.png" alt="Art picture"/> <br/>
                                </div> 
                                <h3>Core loop</h3>
                                <p>You spawn near the mothership, receive a quest about destroying enemy spaceships, complete it, and return to the mothership to 
                                deliver the plunder, which you can spend to upgrade your ship.</p>
                                <h3>Scope of the project</h3>
                                <p>The scope of the project is described well in the core loop. This is what we were going for, but it is important to know that
                                    this was our first game, and that we had 4 days to complete this, while not all members of the team had very good programming skills.
                                    The whole game took two weeks, but the first week was about brainstorming, prototyping and documenting the game.
                                </p>
                                <p><b>What we achieved:</b>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Fully functional movement of the spaceship, being able to pitch, roll and yaw, and the boost mechanic</li>
                                        <li>Being able to shoot and destroy enemies</li>
                                        <li>Enemy AI that follow and attack you, and act like a swarm, but that will de-aggro if you move far enough</li>
                                        <li>HUD, including the bars at the bottom for health and thrust, and the enemy markers that are displayed around the crosshair</li>
                                        <li>Quests, which are looting the credits that the enemy spaceships drop after being destroyed, looting cargo
                                            that is floating around the map, and to kill all enemy spaceships, which will give the player a load more credits
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p><b>What we didn't achieve:</b>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>An active text/indicator of the objectives and quests</li>
                                        <li>Being able to return to the spaceship after finishing the objectives</li>
                                        <li>Being able to spend the cargo and make upgrades to the spaceship</li>
                                        <li>Better lighting, since the enemy spaceships are hard to see</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>The game will be playable on itch.io soon.</p>

                                        <p style="margin-left: 5%;">Functionality to move and control the spaceship in the game. The
                                            spaceship can move forward and backward by giving it thrust or
                                            reversing, while the pitch and yaw are controlled by the mouse or
                                            controller right analog stick. Rolling the ship can be done with the
                                            correspondent key presses. The ship has a little bit of drag in order to
                                            make it more realistic, for example when starting to roll, the ship will
                                            stop rolling at a certain time because of the drag, and it will not
                                            continue to roll forever, since it's not affected by gravity.</p>
