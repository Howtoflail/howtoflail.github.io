									<h1>Food delivery webapp</h1>
									<p>A fullstack webapp that was created using React for frontend and SpringBoot for backend. <br/>
										This web application has Docker configured for continuous integration and uses SonarQube for code quality.
									</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This application was made for a university project for the third semester and it's purpose was to get me familiarized with 
									creating and configuring a solid REST API for the needs of a specific business/application, but also having a user-friendly frontend,
									so that the user can easily use the website.</p>
								<p>The web application excels mostly at the backend, having a solid foundation for most of the needs of a food delivery application.</p>
								<h2>Features of the application</h2>
								<p>One of the most common, but most important features of food delivery applications, is to have the ability to <b>create accounts</b>
									because it is very convenient to just log back in the website every time and have all of your personal data and address saved
									and order food within seconds.
								</p>
								<p>On this application, you need to create an account in order to use it.</p>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/CreateUser.png" alt="User creation form" style="height: 80%; width: 80%;"/></div>
								<p>All forms on the website are validated because every piece of data that interacts with the database is following a format declared 
									by request classes in the backend.</p>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/DeliveryHomePage.png" alt="Home page" style="height: 90%; width: 90%;"/></div>
								<p>Once logged in, a user can see all the restaurants on the home page.</p>
								<p>Logging in is done through the use of authentification and authorization. The webapp uses JWT tokens to differentiate between roles.</p>
								<p><b>Users can click on a restaurant in order to see what items they offer.</b></p>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/UserOrdersFood.png" alt="User orders food" style="height: 90%; width: 90%;"/></div>
								<p>On the restaurant's page, the user can choose the items and the quantity that he wants to order, which is displayed in a basket
									that also shows the total calculated in real time.</p>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/Checkout.png" alt="Checkout" style="height: 90%; width: 90%;"/></div>
								<p>The user can see all details of the order, including personal details, before confirming it.</p>
								<br/>
								<p>A user can also check his <b>order history</b>:</p>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/OrderHistory.png" alt="Order history" style="height: 90%; width: 90%;"/></div>
								<!-- later -->
								<p><b>Businesses can join the food delivery platform</b> through the "Join us!" button that can be seen in the navigation bar,
									which will open up a form. After filling the form, the restaurant owner can log in with the account,</p>
